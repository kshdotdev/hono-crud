# hono-crud Development Rules

## TypeScript Rules

### NEVER use `any` type
- Use `unknown` for values of unknown type
- Create proper interfaces for known structures
- Use type assertions with `as unknown as TargetType` when casting is necessary
- Prefer generics over `any` for flexible typing

### Drizzle Adapter Pattern
The Drizzle adapter uses a two-tier type system (packages/drizzle/src/helpers.ts):
1. **Public constraint** (`DrizzleDatabaseConstraint`): structural bound with `unknown` members
   (`select`/`insert`/`update`/`delete`/`transaction`), used as the `DB` generic bound on every
   endpoint class — any Drizzle database satisfies it without coupling to drizzle-orm types.
2. **Internal interfaces** (`Database<Row>`, `QueryBuilder<Row>`): typed method signatures used
   inside the adapter; `Row` derives from the consumer's Zod schema (`ModelObject<M['model']>`),
   never from a drizzle-orm type. `QueryBuilder<Row>` is `PromiseLike<Row[]>`.
3. **Casting function** (`cast<Row>()`): the single sanctioned boundary `as`, converting an
   unknown database instance to `Database<Row>` for internal method calls.
This pattern avoids coupling to specific Drizzle versions while maintaining internal type safety.

## Adapter Behavior Rules

1. **Post-response async work always goes through `runAfterResponse`/`getWaitUntil`** — never
   bare fire-and-forget. On Cloudflare Workers the runtime kills pending promises when the
   response returns; a `.then`/`.catch` chain alone silently drops the work.
2. **Any change to adapter-visible behavior must add or modify a `tests/conformance/` cell in
   the same PR.** Cells assert exact behavior (status codes, error envelopes) or a loud
   unsupported-capability rejection — never a silent skip. The conformance suite is the ratchet
   that keeps memory/drizzle/prisma from drifting apart.
3. **Upsert family (upsert / import / batchUpsert) is match-and-restore**: `findExisting`
   matches soft-deleted rows; the core orchestrator clears the soft-delete field on update via
   `applyUpsertRestore`. Adapters share one `findByUpsertKeys` helper each. Native SQL upsert
   paths (Drizzle ON CONFLICT) document their divergence instead of pretending to comply.
4. **like/ilike contract** (defined on `FILTER_OPERATORS`): user value is a literal needle —
   `%` stripped, `_` inert, never live SQL wildcards. `like` follows database collation case
   behavior (strict in memory); `ilike` is always case-insensitive.

## Error-Split Doctrine

**Request-time misconfiguration → `ConfigurationException`** (500 `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`,
flows through createErrorHandler); **setup-time factory validation → plain `Error`**
(fail-fast at boot, e.g. `multiTenant`'s custom-source-without-extractor check). A throw
site picks by WHEN it fires, not what it complains about.

## Confirmed-Intentional Asymmetries

Adjudicated differences between sibling packages — never "fix" these for symmetry:

1. **No Cloudflare KV idempotency backend** (cache and rate-limit ship `cloudflare-kv.ts`;
   idempotency ships only memory + redis). The in-flight lock MUST be atomic
   compare-and-set (`SET NX PX`); KV has no CAS, so a KV lock would be advisory only — a
   correctness footgun for the one feature whose failure mode is duplicate side effects.
   Workers users go through Upstash Redis; Durable Objects (not KV) is the primitive for a
   possible future first-party backend.
2. **Key-prefix ownership differs between cache and rate-limit.** Cache storage adapters own
   a non-empty default prefix (`'cache:'`) because `clear()`, `deletePattern()`, and tag
   indices are keyspace-scoped operations on a possibly shared physical store (with `''`,
   `RedisCacheStorage.clear()` would wipe the whole DB). Rate-limit's middleware owns the
   `'rl'` prefix and its adapters default to `''`. Rule: a storage adapter owns a non-empty
   default prefix iff it performs keyspace-scoped operations on a shareable physical store.
3. **`MemoryRateLimitStorage` has no `maxEntries` knob** (its memory/cache/idempotency
   siblings are capacity-bounded). Capacity eviction of a live window would silently reset
   its counter, weakening limits exactly under key-flood pressure; memory stays bounded via
   the `cleanupIntervalMs` sweep of expired windows.

## Naming Doctrine

1. `create<Feature>Middleware()` — app.use-style cross-cutting middleware factories.
   **Documented exceptions (rename only with owner sign-off):** `multiTenant()`, `apiVersion()`,
   and `apiVersionedResponse()` keep their feature-named forms. Each anchors a feature family
   whose entire public surface shares the feature prefix (`apiVersion`/`getApiVersion`/
   `getApiVersionConfig`/`ApiVersionEnv`/`CONTEXT_KEYS.apiVersion`; `multiTenant`/
   `MultiTenantConfig`/`MultiTenantMiddlewareConfig`/`TenantEnv`), so a `create<Feature>Middleware`
   spelling would break family symmetry for zero disambiguation gain. The old bare-noun
   `idempotency` factory was renamed because its name collided with its package name and it
   anchored no such accessor family.
2. `with<Feature>()` — class mixins only.
3. `<vendor>UI()` / `docsIndex()` — GET-mounted documentation-page factories returning
   `MiddlewareHandler` (sanctioned family modeled on `scalarUI`; they are page handlers, not
   cross-cutting middleware, hence not `create*Middleware`). **Family field vocabulary
   (ScalarConfig is the source):** `specUrl` = location of the OpenAPI spec the page loads;
   `pageTitle` = the HTML `<title>`; `<sibling>Path` (`docsPath`/`redocPath`/`scalarPath`) =
   href of a sibling docs page rendered as a link.
4. `create<Feature>Routes()` — router factories returning a mountable `Hono` when a feature
   genuinely owns multiple routes (health).
5. `*Config` = top-level setup bag of a middleware/factory; `*Options` = per-operation/per-call
   leaf bag (and storage-adapter constructor bags).
6. **Model feature toggles:** `boolean | Config` when every option is defaultable (softDelete,
   multiTenant, audit, versioning); presence-enables when the config has required members
   (fieldEncryption, relations, computedFields, policies); never a required `enabled` field.
7. **Duration fields:** every public duration field carries a unit suffix naming its existing
   unit (`*Seconds` or `*Ms`); renames only, never unit conversions. Exception: `retryAfter`
   (mirrors HTTP Retry-After header semantics, seconds by RFC).

### Config vs Options naming
- `*Config` — the top-level bag a middleware factory, route/router factory, or feature factory
  accepts once at setup time (RateLimitConfig, IdempotencyConfig, HealthConfig, ScalarConfig,
  ApiVersioningConfig, MultiTenantMiddlewareConfig, CrudMcpConfig, SwaggerUIConfig).
- `*Options` — a leaf bag scoped to a single operation/call or sub-feature (ListOptions,
  SearchOptions, ExportOptions, CacheSetOptions, ToolOptions, ResourceOptions), and
  storage-adapter constructor bags (KVRateLimitStorageOptions).
- Documented exceptions (legacy, rename only with owner sign-off): RouterOptions,
  RegisterCrudOptions, CreateDrizzleCrudOptions, PerTenantOpenApiOptions.

## Export Surface Doctrine

1. **Each feature subpath barrel is the complete canonical surface of its feature.** If a
   symbol belongs to a feature family (auth, logging, storage, events, serialization,
   encryption, api-version, audit, versioning, multi-tenant, functional, builder, config,
   health, cloudflare), it is importable from that subpath and nowhere else.
2. **The root barrel (`hono-crud`) owns only the CRUD core** — model/meta, router/registrar,
   endpoint classes and their result types, exceptions/error-handler, generic context helpers,
   core infra utils, and OpenAPI utilities. It may never export renamed aliases.
3. **`/internal` is an explicit curated list** — `export * from './index'` is forbidden in
   `packages/core/src/internal.ts`. Every re-export is named, grouped by category.
4. **First-party satellites import only from `hono-crud/internal`** (plus their own deps) —
   never from the root barrel or feature subpaths.
5. **Package categories:** a separate npm package requires vendor-dep isolation, or a DB
   adapter, or a core-extension. Anything else is a core subpath, not a new package.

## Edge Runtime Compatibility

This library targets edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun). All library source code in `src/` must be edge-safe.

### Banned Node.js APIs (never use in library source code)
- `fs`, `path`, `os`, `child_process`, `net`, `http`, `https`, `dgram`, `cluster`, `worker_threads`, `vm`, `tls`, `dns`, `readline`
- `crypto` from Node.js — use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`, `crypto.getRandomValues()`) instead
- `createRequire` / `require()` from `'module'`
- `Buffer` — use `Uint8Array` + `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`
- `process` — use Hono's `env()` from `hono/adapter` for env vars
- `__dirname`, `__filename`
- `setInterval` — not available in all edge runtimes
- `global`/`globalThis` for mutable state — use Hono context or request-scoped storage
- Any `node:*` prefixed imports

### Required Web Standard alternatives
| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| Node.js `crypto` | `crypto.subtle` / `crypto.getRandomValues()` |
| `Buffer` | `Uint8Array` / `ArrayBuffer` |
| `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` | Already Web Standard (keep using) |
| `process.env` | `env()` from `hono/adapter` |
| `require()` | Dynamic `import()` |
| Node.js `fetch` | Global `fetch` (Web Standard) |

### Dependency rules
- Every new dependency must be edge-compatible (no Node.js-only packages)
- Prefer packages that explicitly support Cloudflare Workers / edge runtimes
- Never add `node:*` prefixed imports

### Code patterns
- Use dynamic `import()` for optional dependencies — never `require()` or `createRequire`
- No `eval()` or `new Function()`
- Keep cold-start cost low: lazy-load heavy optional modules, avoid top-level side effects
- Examples (`examples/`) may use Node.js APIs since they're not shipped as library code
