Dedup batch: the edge-safe in-memory TTL machinery, the cache entry wire format, and the relation-batching control flow each now live in exactly one place.

- New internal `MemoryTtlStore` in core (exported via `hono-crud/internal`) owns lazy cleanup-on-access, expiry-on-read, and insertion-order capacity eviction. The cache, rate-limit, and idempotency memory storages compose it, supplying only their entry shapes and domain indices (cache tag index via an eviction hook, idempotency locks as a second store). Public constructor options are unchanged. The logging memory storage intentionally stays standalone — its newest-first ordering is a different structure, not drift.
- New cache entry codec (`packages/cache/src/entry.ts`, internal): `buildCacheEntry` / `normalizeStoredEntry` / `isCacheEntryExpired` shared by the memory, Redis, and Cloudflare KV backends — including the single canonical legacy-Date migration guard, so already-persisted entries keep reading identically.
- New relation-batching orchestrator in core (exported via `hono-crud/internal`): the ORM-agnostic control flow (key collection, grouping, map-back, lookup-map dispatch over hasOne/hasMany/belongsTo) is shared; drizzle, prisma, and memory supply only their query adapters. N+1 batching fixes now land in one place.
- Two deliberate behavior fixes that the dedup surfaced: (1) single-item relation reads in the memory and drizzle adapters now always set the relation key (`null` / `[]` instead of absent), matching the batch path and prisma — this also fixes memory's belongsTo gating on the row's own `id` instead of the foreign key; (2) the rate-limit fixed window no longer slides its stored expiry on within-window increments — the window keeps its original `windowStart + windowMs` end.
- Internal-only removals (never publicly exported): memory's `loadRelation`, prisma's `loadPrismaRelation`.
