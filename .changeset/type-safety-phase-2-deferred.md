Type-safety hardening (phase 2, deferred items): validate the JWT trust boundary and single-source the error envelope.

- **Validate JWT claims (security).** The JWT middleware previously coerced the verified payload to `JWTClaims` with a blind `payload as unknown as JWTClaims` cast — Hono's `verify` checks the signature and `exp`/`nbf` timing but not claim *shapes*, so a structurally malformed payload was trusted. The verified payload now runs through `safeParseJWTClaims`; a payload that fails the schema is rejected with `401 Invalid token claims`. `JWTClaimsSchema` was extended with the identity claims the default extractor reads (`email`, `role`, `roles`, `permissions`, `metadata`), and `JWTClaims` is now derived from it (single source). The wrong `secret as string` cast (which mistyped a `CryptoKey` secret) was removed.
- **Fix role normalization.** `defaultExtractUser` previously assigned a singular `role` claim straight to `AuthUser.roles`, producing a value mistyped as `string[]`. `role` / single-string `roles` claims are now normalized to a string array.
- **Single-source the error envelope.** The `{ success: false, error: { code, message, details? } }` contract was hand-restated as TS types in `core/types.ts`, as the return type of `ApiException.toJSON()`, and inline in the idempotency middleware. There is now one `structuredErrorSchema` / `errorEnvelopeSchema` (plus a `successEnvelopeSchema(result)` factory); `StructuredError` and `ErrorResponse` are derived from them via `z.infer`, `ApiException.toJSON()` returns the shared `ErrorResponse`, and the idempotency bodies use a typed helper bound to it.

New additive exports: `structuredErrorSchema`, `errorEnvelopeSchema`, `successEnvelopeSchema` (from `hono-crud`).

**Behavior change:** JWT tokens whose payloads do not match `JWTClaimsSchema` (e.g. a non-numeric `exp`, a non-string `sub`) are now rejected rather than accepted. This is the intended security tightening; the identity claims are typed leniently (`roles`/`permissions` accept a string or array) to avoid rejecting common real-world token shapes.
