# @hono-crud/scalar

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 66f789c: Naming + docs sweep (breaking, patch): one name per role across the whole library, and the docs now document the code that exists.

  - Middleware factories: `idempotency()` → `createIdempotencyMiddleware()`. (`multiTenant()`/`apiVersion()` keep their feature-named forms — each anchors an accessor family sharing its prefix; the doctrine in CLAUDE.md documents the rule and the exceptions.)
  - Surface packages are Hono-idiomatic factories you mount yourself: swagger's `setupSwaggerUI`/`setupReDoc`/`setupDocsIndex` (app mutators) become `swaggerUI()`/`redocUI()`/`docsIndex()` returning `MiddlewareHandler` with `SwaggerUIConfig`/`RedocUIConfig`/`DocsIndexConfig` (adopting scalar's `specUrl`/`pageTitle` vocabulary; `UIOptions` deleted); scalar's `setupScalar` is deleted (`app.get(path, scalarUI(config))`); health's `createHealthEndpoints`/`createHealthHandler` collapse into `createHealthRoutes(config): Hono` mounted via `app.route()`.
  - The word "Versioning" now means record history only: HTTP negotiation renames to `ApiVersioningConfig` (was `VersioningMiddlewareConfig`), `ApiVersionStrategy`, `ApiVersionTransformer`, `apiVersionedResponse()`.
  - Multi-tenant has one source-of-truth union: new exported `TenantIdSource` owned by the model-level `MultiTenantConfig`; the middleware config derives from it and renames to `MultiTenantMiddlewareConfig` (was `*Options`). Runtime defaults unchanged.
  - `CrudMcpOptions` → `CrudMcpConfig` per the now-documented Config-vs-Options rule.
  - Rate-limit key prefix unified: one exported `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_KEY_PREFIX = 'rl'`; the KV and Redis storage prefixes no longer add their own divergent defaults ('rl:'/'ratelimit:'), so all backends build identical keys. In-flight rate-limit windows under old prefixes expire naturally.
  - Vestigial `RouterOptions.base`/`docs_url`/`redoc_url` deleted (UI paths live in the swagger/scalar packages; `openapi_url` stays).
  - One API-key hasher: the canonical `hashAPIKey` moves to `auth/hash.ts` and `defaultHashAPIKey` is now an alias of it — hashing is byte-identical, stored keys keep matching.
  - Sorting aliases removed from the functional config: `orderByFields`/`defaultOrderBy`/`defaultOrderDirection` and `SortingConfig.defaultDirection` are gone — canonical `sortFields`/`defaultSort`/`defaultOrder` only.
  - Drizzle's stale 5-verb `DrizzleAdapters` bundle in factory.ts is deleted; the 17-entry bundle in the package barrel is the only one, mirroring prisma and memory.
  - Docs: CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md gain the naming doctrine and a corrected Drizzle Adapter Pattern section using the real type names (`DrizzleDatabaseConstraint`, `Database<Row>`, `QueryBuilder<Row>`, `cast<Row>()`); all docs/READMEs/examples migrated to the new names and call patterns.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- dd62008: Publishing metadata fixes: `CHANGELOG.md` is now included in the published npm artifact (it was missing from the `files` allowlist everywhere except core), and the lazily-loaded libraries `drizzle-zod` (drizzle), `pluralize` and `fastest-levenshtein` (prisma) are now optional peer dependencies — they are dynamically imported with graceful fallbacks, so consumers who don't use those features no longer have to install them.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- b880e53: Type-safety hardening (phase 1): eliminate type/schema drift and silent fall-throughs.

  - **Unify `HonoOpenAPIApp`.** The publicly re-exported type was a 4-verb subset that disagreed with the 7-verb superset `fromHono` actually returns; both now resolve to one canonical definition, so typing the documented `HonoOpenAPIApp` and calling `.options()`/`.head()`/`.doc()` type-checks.
  - **Closed-union exhaustiveness.** Filter-operator handling now goes through a single shared `matchesFilter` in the in-memory adapter (the four copy-pasted switches had drifted — one was missing `between` and silently matched every row), and the Drizzle/Prisma/aggregate switches gained `assertNever` exhaustiveness guards so a future operator is a compile error rather than a silent gap.
  - **Validate untrusted filter operators.** `parseFilterValue` no longer blindly casts an unrecognized `field[op]=value` token to `FilterOperator` (which downstream adapters silently ignored, disabling the filter); unknown operators now fall back to literal equality. `FilterOperator` is now derived from a single `as const` `FILTER_OPERATORS` source with an `isFilterOperator` guard.
  - **Scalar config.** `@hono-crud/scalar` no longer escapes its own typing via `as Record<string, unknown>`; `ScalarTheme` is derived from the upstream `ApiReferenceConfiguration` and `scalarUI` has an explicit return type.
  - **De-duplicated casts.** Added a localized `readResponseEnvelope(ctx)` accessor and a Drizzle `readCount`/`CountRow` helper, removing repeated inline casts.

  New exports: `FILTER_OPERATORS`, `isFilterOperator`, `assertNever`, `readResponseEnvelope` (from `hono-crud`); `readCount`/`CountRow` (from `@hono-crud/drizzle`). All additive; no breaking changes.
