## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- dd62008: Aggregate filters now fail closed on unknown operators across all adapters. Memory's `MemoryAggregateEndpoint` delegated to its own inline 6-operator switch with a fail-open default (unknown operators matched every record); it now delegates to `matchesFilter()`, the fail-closed single source of truth, and supports all 12 operators. Prisma's aggregate where-builder forwarded unrecognized operator strings verbatim into the Prisma where clause and 500'd on documented operators like `between`/`ilike`; it now validates with `isFilterOperator()` and delegates to `buildPrismaWhere`. Drizzle's aggregate path cast untrusted operator strings and crashed via `assertNever` on unknown operators; it now validates first and pushes a never-true condition instead. In every adapter an unknown operator now matches nothing (count 0) instead of leaking data or crashing.
- dd62008: Publishing metadata fixes: `CHANGELOG.md` is now included in the published npm artifact (it was missing from the `files` allowlist everywhere except core), and the lazily-loaded libraries `drizzle-zod` (drizzle), `pluralize` and `fastest-levenshtein` (prisma) are now optional peer dependencies — they are dynamically imported with graceful fallbacks, so consumers who don't use those features no longer have to install them.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 255aaf3: Thread a row/DB type generic through both ORM adapters so query results are typed instead of `unknown`, removing the internal `as ModelObject<...>` laundering casts. Breaking: the Drizzle adapter drops the `DrizzleDatabase`/`DrizzleDB` aliases (use `DrizzleDatabaseConstraint` or the new third `DB` generic on endpoint classes) and its public API no longer references drizzle-orm builder types (`Table`/`Column`/`SQL`); `PrismaModelOperations` gains a `Row` type parameter plus `aggregate`/`groupBy` members.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- b880e53: Type-safety hardening (phase 1): eliminate type/schema drift and silent fall-throughs.

  - **Unify `HonoOpenAPIApp`.** The publicly re-exported type was a 4-verb subset that disagreed with the 7-verb superset `fromHono` actually returns; both now resolve to one canonical definition, so typing the documented `HonoOpenAPIApp` and calling `.options()`/`.head()`/`.doc()` type-checks.
  - **Closed-union exhaustiveness.** Filter-operator handling now goes through a single shared `matchesFilter` in the in-memory adapter (the four copy-pasted switches had drifted — one was missing `between` and silently matched every row), and the Drizzle/Prisma/aggregate switches gained `assertNever` exhaustiveness guards so a future operator is a compile error rather than a silent gap.
  - **Validate untrusted filter operators.** `parseFilterValue` no longer blindly casts an unrecognized `field[op]=value` token to `FilterOperator` (which downstream adapters silently ignored, disabling the filter); unknown operators now fall back to literal equality. `FilterOperator` is now derived from a single `as const` `FILTER_OPERATORS` source with an `isFilterOperator` guard.
  - **Scalar config.** `@hono-crud/scalar` no longer escapes its own typing via `as Record<string, unknown>`; `ScalarTheme` is derived from the upstream `ApiReferenceConfiguration` and `scalarUI` has an explicit return type.
  - **De-duplicated casts.** Added a localized `readResponseEnvelope(ctx)` accessor and a Drizzle `readCount`/`CountRow` helper, removing repeated inline casts.

  New exports: `FILTER_OPERATORS`, `isFilterOperator`, `assertNever`, `readResponseEnvelope` (from `hono-crud`); `readCount`/`CountRow` (from `@hono-crud/drizzle`). All additive; no breaking changes.

- 18a86c2: Type-safety hardening (phase 2): derive types from single `as const` / Zod sources so the compile-time union and its runtime validators can no longer drift.

  - **Union single-sources.** `SortDirection`, `SearchMode`, `AggregateOperation`, `JWTAlgorithm` (core) and `DrizzleDialect` (drizzle) are now derived from exported `as const` arrays (`SORT_DIRECTIONS`, `SEARCH_MODES`, `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS`, `JWT_ALGORITHMS`, `DRIZZLE_DIALECTS`). The three `z.enum(['asc','desc'])` schemas and the `z.enum(['any','all','phrase'])` schema now reference these arrays, and the aggregate query parser derives its runtime operation lists from `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS` instead of hand-maintained copies.
  - **Removed a redundant type.** The JWT middleware's `HonoAlgorithm` type and its hand-maintained `supported` allow-list were exact duplicates of `JWTAlgorithm`; both are gone (and with them two casts) — `validateAlgorithm` checks against `JWT_ALGORITHMS` directly.
  - **`SortSpec`.** The repeated inline `{ field: string; order: 'asc' | 'desc' }` shape across list/search/builder/functional/config is now the named `SortSpec` type.
  - **Schema-derived shapes.** `EncryptedValue` is inferred from a new `encryptedValueSchema` and `isEncryptedValue` validates with `.safeParse` (one shape, not a hand-written twin). `CrudEventType` is single-sourced from `CRUD_EVENT_TYPES`, and the webhook event-filter template-literal type derives from it, so a new event type can't silently become unfilterable.

  New additive exports: `SORT_DIRECTIONS`, `SEARCH_MODES`, `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS`, `SortDirection`, `SortSpec`, `JWT_ALGORITHMS`, `CRUD_EVENT_TYPES`, `encryptedValueSchema` (from `hono-crud`); `DRIZZLE_DIALECTS`, `readCount`, `CountRow` (from `@hono-crud/drizzle`). All derived types are structurally identical to what they replaced — no breaking changes.
