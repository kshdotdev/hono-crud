# @hono-crud/drizzle

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 66f789c: Naming + docs sweep (breaking, patch): one name per role across the whole library, and the docs now document the code that exists.

  - Middleware factories: `idempotency()` → `createIdempotencyMiddleware()`. (`multiTenant()`/`apiVersion()` keep their feature-named forms — each anchors an accessor family sharing its prefix; the doctrine in CLAUDE.md documents the rule and the exceptions.)
  - Surface packages are Hono-idiomatic factories you mount yourself: swagger's `setupSwaggerUI`/`setupReDoc`/`setupDocsIndex` (app mutators) become `swaggerUI()`/`redocUI()`/`docsIndex()` returning `MiddlewareHandler` with `SwaggerUIConfig`/`RedocUIConfig`/`DocsIndexConfig` (adopting scalar's `specUrl`/`pageTitle` vocabulary; `UIOptions` deleted); scalar's `setupScalar` is deleted (`app.get(path, scalarUI(config))`); health's `createHealthEndpoints`/`createHealthHandler` collapse into `createHealthRoutes(config): Hono` mounted via `app.route()`.
  - The word "Versioning" now means record history only: HTTP negotiation renames to `ApiVersioningConfig` (was `VersioningMiddlewareConfig`), `ApiVersionStrategy`, `ApiVersionTransformer`, `apiVersionedResponse()`.
  - Multi-tenant has one source-of-truth union: new exported `TenantIdSource` owned by the model-level `MultiTenantConfig`; the middleware config derives from it and renames to `MultiTenantMiddlewareConfig` (was `*Options`). Runtime defaults unchanged.
  - `CrudMcpOptions` → `CrudMcpConfig` per the now-documented Config-vs-Options rule.
  - Rate-limit key prefix unified: one exported `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_KEY_PREFIX = 'rl'`; the KV and Redis storage prefixes no longer add their own divergent defaults ('rl:'/'ratelimit:'), so all backends build identical keys. In-flight rate-limit windows under old prefixes expire naturally.
  - Vestigial `RouterOptions.base`/`docs_url`/`redoc_url` deleted (UI paths live in the swagger/scalar packages; `openapi_url` stays).
  - One API-key hasher: the canonical `hashAPIKey` moves to `auth/hash.ts` and `defaultHashAPIKey` is now an alias of it — hashing is byte-identical, stored keys keep matching.
  - Sorting aliases removed from the functional config: `orderByFields`/`defaultOrderBy`/`defaultOrderDirection` and `SortingConfig.defaultDirection` are gone — canonical `sortFields`/`defaultSort`/`defaultOrder` only.
  - Drizzle's stale 5-verb `DrizzleAdapters` bundle in factory.ts is deleted; the 17-entry bundle in the package barrel is the only one, mirroring prisma and memory.
  - Docs: CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md gain the naming doctrine and a corrected Drizzle Adapter Pattern section using the real type names (`DrizzleDatabaseConstraint`, `Database<Row>`, `QueryBuilder<Row>`, `cast<Row>()`); all docs/READMEs/examples migrated to the new names and call patterns.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 97e92f5: Dedup batch: the edge-safe in-memory TTL machinery, the cache entry wire format, and the relation-batching control flow each now live in exactly one place.

  - New internal `MemoryTtlStore` in core (exported via `hono-crud/internal`) owns lazy cleanup-on-access, expiry-on-read, and insertion-order capacity eviction. The cache, rate-limit, and idempotency memory storages compose it, supplying only their entry shapes and domain indices (cache tag index via an eviction hook, idempotency locks as a second store). Public constructor options are unchanged. The logging memory storage intentionally stays standalone — its newest-first ordering is a different structure, not drift.
  - New cache entry codec (`packages/cache/src/entry.ts`, internal): `buildCacheEntry` / `normalizeStoredEntry` / `isCacheEntryExpired` shared by the memory, Redis, and Cloudflare KV backends — including the single canonical legacy-Date migration guard, so already-persisted entries keep reading identically.
  - New relation-batching orchestrator in core (exported via `hono-crud/internal`): the ORM-agnostic control flow (key collection, grouping, map-back, lookup-map dispatch over hasOne/hasMany/belongsTo) is shared; drizzle, prisma, and memory supply only their query adapters. N+1 batching fixes now land in one place.
  - Two deliberate behavior fixes that the dedup surfaced: (1) single-item relation reads in the memory and drizzle adapters now always set the relation key (`null` / `[]` instead of absent), matching the batch path and prisma — this also fixes memory's belongsTo gating on the row's own `id` instead of the foreign key; (2) the rate-limit fixed window no longer slides its stored expiry on within-window increments — the window keeps its original `windowStart + windowMs` end.
  - Internal-only removals (never publicly exported): memory's `loadRelation`, prisma's `loadPrismaRelation`.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 8244828: Storage unification (breaking, patch): one injection story and one contract shape for all eight first-party storages.

  - `createCrudMiddleware` / `CrudMiddlewareConfig` are removed. `createStorageMiddleware` is the single injection middleware and now accepts all eight slots (`loggingStorage`, `auditStorage`, `versioningStorage`, `apiKeyStorage`, `cacheStorage`, `rateLimitStorage`, `idempotencyStorage`, `eventEmitter`), each writing the matching `CONTEXT_KEYS` context var. New single-storage factories: `createCacheStorageMiddleware`, `createRateLimitStorageMiddleware`, `createIdempotencyStorageMiddleware`.
  - `CONTEXT_KEYS` (now exported from `hono-crud` and `hono-crud/internal`) is the complete registry of context-var keys, adding `db`, `cacheStorage`, `rateLimitStorage`, `idempotencyStorage`, `rateLimit`, `rateLimitKey`, `responseEnvelope`, `policies`. All key strings are unchanged; cache/rate-limit/idempotency context resolution is now actually live (previously their context tier read keys no middleware wrote).
  - Every storage feature exposes the same two-getter contract: `getXStorage(): T | null` (never throws) plus `getXStorageRequired(): T`. Consequences: `getAuditStorage` / `getVersioningStorage` / `getCacheStorage` return types are now nullable (`getCacheStorage` stays never-null at runtime via its lazy memory default); `getIdempotencyStorage` no longer throws — the old throwing behavior moved to `getIdempotencyStorageRequired`. New: `getLoggingStorageRequired`, `getAuditStorageRequired`, `getVersioningStorageRequired`, `getCacheStorageRequired`, `getRateLimitStorageRequired`, `getIdempotencyStorageRequired`.
  - `VersioningStorage.save(entry)` is renamed to `store(tableName, entry)` — interface method rename; third-party implementations must update. The `entry.id.split(':')` table-name hack is gone and `VersionManager` no longer duck-types.
  - `CacheStorage.set` option `ttl` (seconds) is now `ttlMs` (milliseconds); cache storage constructors take `defaultTtlMs` (default `300_000`) instead of `defaultTtl`. User-facing `CacheConfig.ttl` stays seconds and is converted once in the mixin.
  - `IdempotencyStorage.destroy` is now optional and `cleanup?(): Promise<number>` is part of the optional contract (the memory implementation's cleanup returns the number of entries removed).
  - `APIKeyConfig.lookupKey` is now optional and `APIKeyConfig.storage?: APIKeyStorage` was added; the API-key middleware resolves storage through the registry (explicit > context > global), so `setAPIKeyStorage` is no longer a silent no-op. Configs with neither `lookupKey` nor a resolvable storage throw `ConfigurationException`.
  - The `CacheStorage` / `RateLimitStorage` / `IdempotencyStorage` contracts now live in core and are re-exported by their plugins via `hono-crud/internal` (type identity preserved).
  - Endpoints now thread the request context into audit/versioning managers, so context-injected storage is honored (previously silently ignored).
  - Non-breaking type tightening: `POLICIES_CONTEXT_KEY` narrows from `string` to its literal type.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- dd62008: Aggregate filters now fail closed on unknown operators across all adapters. Memory's `MemoryAggregateEndpoint` delegated to its own inline 6-operator switch with a fail-open default (unknown operators matched every record); it now delegates to `matchesFilter()`, the fail-closed single source of truth, and supports all 12 operators. Prisma's aggregate where-builder forwarded unrecognized operator strings verbatim into the Prisma where clause and 500'd on documented operators like `between`/`ilike`; it now validates with `isFilterOperator()` and delegates to `buildPrismaWhere`. Drizzle's aggregate path cast untrusted operator strings and crashed via `assertNever` on unknown operators; it now validates first and pushes a never-true condition instead. In every adapter an unknown operator now matches nothing (count 0) instead of leaking data or crashing.
- dd62008: Publishing metadata fixes: `CHANGELOG.md` is now included in the published npm artifact (it was missing from the `files` allowlist everywhere except core), and the lazily-loaded libraries `drizzle-zod` (drizzle), `pluralize` and `fastest-levenshtein` (prisma) are now optional peer dependencies — they are dynamically imported with graceful fallbacks, so consumers who don't use those features no longer have to install them.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 255aaf3: Thread a row/DB type generic through both ORM adapters so query results are typed instead of `unknown`, removing the internal `as ModelObject<...>` laundering casts. Breaking: the Drizzle adapter drops the `DrizzleDatabase`/`DrizzleDB` aliases (use `DrizzleDatabaseConstraint` or the new third `DB` generic on endpoint classes) and its public API no longer references drizzle-orm builder types (`Table`/`Column`/`SQL`); `PrismaModelOperations` gains a `Row` type parameter plus `aggregate`/`groupBy` members.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- b880e53: Type-safety hardening (phase 1): eliminate type/schema drift and silent fall-throughs.

  - **Unify `HonoOpenAPIApp`.** The publicly re-exported type was a 4-verb subset that disagreed with the 7-verb superset `fromHono` actually returns; both now resolve to one canonical definition, so typing the documented `HonoOpenAPIApp` and calling `.options()`/`.head()`/`.doc()` type-checks.
  - **Closed-union exhaustiveness.** Filter-operator handling now goes through a single shared `matchesFilter` in the in-memory adapter (the four copy-pasted switches had drifted — one was missing `between` and silently matched every row), and the Drizzle/Prisma/aggregate switches gained `assertNever` exhaustiveness guards so a future operator is a compile error rather than a silent gap.
  - **Validate untrusted filter operators.** `parseFilterValue` no longer blindly casts an unrecognized `field[op]=value` token to `FilterOperator` (which downstream adapters silently ignored, disabling the filter); unknown operators now fall back to literal equality. `FilterOperator` is now derived from a single `as const` `FILTER_OPERATORS` source with an `isFilterOperator` guard.
  - **Scalar config.** `@hono-crud/scalar` no longer escapes its own typing via `as Record<string, unknown>`; `ScalarTheme` is derived from the upstream `ApiReferenceConfiguration` and `scalarUI` has an explicit return type.
  - **De-duplicated casts.** Added a localized `readResponseEnvelope(ctx)` accessor and a Drizzle `readCount`/`CountRow` helper, removing repeated inline casts.

  New exports: `FILTER_OPERATORS`, `isFilterOperator`, `assertNever`, `readResponseEnvelope` (from `hono-crud`); `readCount`/`CountRow` (from `@hono-crud/drizzle`). All additive; no breaking changes.

- 18a86c2: Type-safety hardening (phase 2): derive types from single `as const` / Zod sources so the compile-time union and its runtime validators can no longer drift.

  - **Union single-sources.** `SortDirection`, `SearchMode`, `AggregateOperation`, `JWTAlgorithm` (core) and `DrizzleDialect` (drizzle) are now derived from exported `as const` arrays (`SORT_DIRECTIONS`, `SEARCH_MODES`, `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS`, `JWT_ALGORITHMS`, `DRIZZLE_DIALECTS`). The three `z.enum(['asc','desc'])` schemas and the `z.enum(['any','all','phrase'])` schema now reference these arrays, and the aggregate query parser derives its runtime operation lists from `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS` instead of hand-maintained copies.
  - **Removed a redundant type.** The JWT middleware's `HonoAlgorithm` type and its hand-maintained `supported` allow-list were exact duplicates of `JWTAlgorithm`; both are gone (and with them two casts) — `validateAlgorithm` checks against `JWT_ALGORITHMS` directly.
  - **`SortSpec`.** The repeated inline `{ field: string; order: 'asc' | 'desc' }` shape across list/search/builder/functional/config is now the named `SortSpec` type.
  - **Schema-derived shapes.** `EncryptedValue` is inferred from a new `encryptedValueSchema` and `isEncryptedValue` validates with `.safeParse` (one shape, not a hand-written twin). `CrudEventType` is single-sourced from `CRUD_EVENT_TYPES`, and the webhook event-filter template-literal type derives from it, so a new event type can't silently become unfilterable.

  New additive exports: `SORT_DIRECTIONS`, `SEARCH_MODES`, `AGGREGATE_OPERATIONS`, `SortDirection`, `SortSpec`, `JWT_ALGORITHMS`, `CRUD_EVENT_TYPES`, `encryptedValueSchema` (from `hono-crud`); `DRIZZLE_DIALECTS`, `readCount`, `CountRow` (from `@hono-crud/drizzle`). All derived types are structurally identical to what they replaced — no breaking changes.
